      <h2>First kiss, last kiss</h2>

      <p class="align-left">
        Michelle and Jon met at <a href="http://www.calumet.org/">Camp Calumet
        Lutheran</a> as teenagers and became friends. They later shared what
        turned out to be both of their first kisses. Sadly, as the years flew
        by, they lost touch throughout college and beyond. But two years ago,
        Michelle discovered that she and Jon shared a mutual friend. Michelle
        asked Jon to lunch. They had a lovely date and picked up where they
        left off. Over the past two years, Michelle and Jon have grown closer
        on trips to St. John, Chicago, and California. Weather permitting, they
        fish at Spot Pond, sail in Boston Harbor, and enjoy nature. They're
        ready to start the next chapter in their lives, joined in marriage.

      <p>Michelle said yes.</p>
